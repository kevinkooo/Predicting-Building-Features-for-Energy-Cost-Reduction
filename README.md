## Project Overview
### Objective
This project aims to identify building features correlated with high energy consumption to help buyers and investors reduce energy expenses effectively using a dataset comprising building characteristics, geographical data, and local weather patterns.
### Data Profile
- U.S. coverage over 7 years 
- 62 features, +75k observations
- Captures energy usage across various building types
- Each row corresponds to a specific building facility at a distinct location
- Target: site_eui (Site Energy Usage Intensity)

## Approach
### Feature engineering
